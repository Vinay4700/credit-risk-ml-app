# credit-risk-ml-app
The Credit Risk ML App is an interactive web application built with Python and Streamlit that predicts the likelihood of a customer defaulting on credit. The app leverages machine learning techniques to analyze historical financial data and provide actionable insights for credit risk assessment.

# Features:
Interactive sidebar to input customer financial information.
Real-time prediction of credit default risk using a Random Forest Classifier.
Displays model accuracy and key metrics to evaluate performance.
Clean, user-friendly interface for quick experimentation and analysis.

# Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, joblib)
Streamlit for interactive web app deployment
Machine Learning: Random Forest, Train-Test Split, Accuracy Evaluation

# Purpose:
This project simulates a real-world credit risk analysis scenario similar to tasks in financial institutions and credit risk teams, providing hands-on experience in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and deployment.

# Usage:
Clone the repository.
Install dependencies from requirements.txt.
Run streamlit run app.py.
Input financial features in the sidebar to predict credit default risk.
